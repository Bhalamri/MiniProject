# MiniProject

Heart disease can be prevented with proper prediction, but
it can also be fatal if the prediction is incorrect The
project starts with raw data in the form of an csv file and
then changes it to data analysis The dataset consists of 14
main attributes used for performing the analysis The main
objective of this project is the prediction of heart disease
using different classification algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine(SVM) and Random Forest Classifier
algorithms The evaluation metrics used is Confusion
Matrix and k fold cross validation score.
